<h1>Introduction to Oceans</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Why Study the Ocean?</h2>
  <h3>About 70% of Earth is covered by ocean</h3>
  <p>The Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land. Of all this water, 97% is found in oceans. The remaining 3% is either locked up in ice caps and glaciers, or is found in fresh-water bodies.</p>
  <h3>230 thousand species have been recorded in the ocean</h3>
  <p>There remains a huge number of undiscovered species. There could be anywhere from 1-10 million in total! Although undiscovered, they could still be important for the ecosystem and could hold the key to big scientific breakthroughs.</p>
  <h3>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income</h3>
  <p>‘Aquaculture’ is marine farming. This includes the breeding and harvesting of fish, shellfish and seaweed.</p>
  <h3>Many other products come from the sea</h3>
  <p>This includes medicine. Coral reefs in particular have very complex ways of fighting off diseases, so there is a lot of interest in this ecosystem from the medical industry.</p>
  <h3>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans</h3>
  <p>As oceans make up most of the Earth’s surface, this means that most of the world remains an unexplored mystery!</p>
  <h3>The ocean connects with the land in a 'global ecosystem'</h3>
  <p>The natural world is a highly connected system. An effect on one thing can have widespread effects. Think of a fish in the sea that gets eaten by a bird. This bird may move in land and be food for a bear.</p>
  <h3>...and because it is UNDER THREAT</h3>
  <p>Climate change, overfishing and ocean acidification are among another of problems caused by human activity that threaten the ocean. There has never been a more important time to support marine conservation.</p>
