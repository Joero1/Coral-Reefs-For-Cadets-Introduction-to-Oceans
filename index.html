<h1>Introduction to Oceans</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Why Study the Ocean?</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>About 70% of Earth is covered by ocean</h3>
  <p>The Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land. Of all this water, 97% is found in oceans. The remaining 3% is either locked up in ice caps and glaciers, or is found in fresh-water bodies.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Life started in the ocean</h3>
  <p>Trace your lineage back enough generations and you will find we are all children of the sea! Starting out as microorganisms from the produce of hydrothermal vents, gradually evolving into complex multicellular life forms, eventually obtaining the ability to colonise the land.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>230 thousand species have been recorded in the ocean</h3>
  <p>There remains a huge number of undiscovered species. There could be anywhere from 1-10 million in total! Although undiscovered, they could still be important for the ecosystem and could hold the key to big scientific breakthroughs.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income</h3>
  <p>‘Aquaculture’ is marine farming. This includes the breeding and harvesting of fish, shellfish and seaweed.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Many other products come from the sea</h3>
  <p>This includes medicine. Coral reefs in particular have very complex ways of fighting off diseases, so there is a lot of interest in this ecosystem from the medical industry.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans</h3>
  <p>As oceans make up most of the Earth’s surface, this means that most of the world remains an unexplored mystery!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>The ocean connects with the land in a 'global ecosystem'</h3>
  <p>The natural world is a highly connected system. An effect on one thing can have widespread effects. Think of a fish in the sea that gets eaten by a bird. This bird may move in land and be food for a bear.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>...and because it is UNDER THREAT</h3>
  <p>Climate change, overfishing and ocean acidification are among another of problems caused by human activity that threaten the ocean. There has never been a more important time to support marine conservation.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Why is the Earth so Wet?</h2>
  <p>For the time being, Earth is the only <em>known</em> planet to have stable bodies of liquid water on its surface. There have been a number of theories as to how are planet came to be so ocean-heavy. These days, most scientists agree on the following explanation.</p>
  <p>Early Earth was a volatile place that was frequently bombarded by asteroids. These asteroids brought with them a very particular chemical. A unique compound made from hydrogen (the first element in the universe) and oxygen (formed from nuclear fusion reactions in stars). We call this chemical water.</p>
  <p>Early Earth was far hotter than it is today due to high volcanic activity and the energy release from swelling pressure inside the planet. At such high temperatures, water remained as gas. The gravity of the Earth prevented it from leaving the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Overtime the Earth's crust began to stabilize, and much of the heat dissipated into space. 3.8 billion years ago,  the Earth cooled below 212 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, the water in the atmosphere condensed into rain. Over millions of years, this rain filled the basins which are now our oceans.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Origins of Life</h3>
  <p>We know that life began at least <strong>3.5 billion years ago</strong>. That is the age of the oldest rocks containing fossil evidence. (Scientists commonly date rocks by examining their radioactive decay.)</p> 
  <p>The seafloor contains structures called hydrothermal vents. These are like natural "chimneys" where magma meets seawater. The result is an ejection of hot fluids into the ocean that include chemicals important for life. These eventually assembled into the first simple cells. It is thought that these first microorganisms may have fed on methane.</p>
  <p><strong>2.15 billion years ago:</strong> Photosynthesis - the ability to use sunlight and carbon dioxide to obtain energy and release oxygen as a by-product - has evolved. This oxygenation will pave the way for the flourishing of life as we know it to come. Not only on land, but even most modern marine organisms require oxygen. There is some evidence to suggest that an earlier time for the start of photosynthesis, but there is much debate around this.</p>
  <p><strong>2 billion years ago:</strong> Many cells became more complex. These cells developed a nucleus: a control centre where the genetic material would be protected. We call these 'eukaryotic' cells. It is thought that they came about by engulfing one another, thus causing one to simply become a compartment within another. One of these compartments became the mitochondria - the powerhouses where respiration would take place to supply the cell with energy. Later on, a similar engulfment happened to photosynthetic bacteria forming the first chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are the parts of the cell in modern plants where all photosynthesis occurs.</p>
  <p><strong>1.5 billion years ago:</strong> The eukaryotes split into three groups: the ancestors of modern plants, fungi and animals. It is believed that they were still all single-celled organisms.</p>
  <p><strong>900 million years ago:</strong> The first multicellular life forms emerged.</p>
  <p><strong>800 million years ago:</strong> Animals split into two groups - sponges and everything else.</p> 
  <p><strong>630 million years ago:</strong> Some animals evolved 'bilateral symmetry'. They have a defined top and bottom, as well as a front and back. These first bilateral animals  were likely to be primitive worms.</p>
  <p><strong>540 million years ago:</strong> The first chordates (animals with a primitive backbone) emerged.</p>
  <p><strong>535 million years ago:</strong> An evolutionary phenomenon called the 'Cambrian explosion' occurred. Many new groups of animals with a variety of body forms emerged.</p>
  <p><strong>530 million years ago:</strong> The first vertebrates (animals with a true backbone) emerge. These were primitive fish that lacked a jawbone, probably like a modern day lamprey or hagfish.</p>
  <p><strong>500 million years ago:</strong> Primitive arthropods started exploring the land. These pioneers are thought to be the common ancestor of insects and crustaceans.</p>
  <p><strong>465 million years ago:</strong> Plants start colonising the land. This puts lots of oxygen into the atmosphere.</p>
  <p><strong>460 million years ago:</strong> Fish split into two groups: bony fish and cartilaginous fish. Bony fish eventually encompass most of the fish species we have today. Cartilaginous fish eventually encompass the sharks, rays and skates.</p>
  <p><strong>465 million years ago:</strong> Lungfish emerge. They have gills like other fish, but also have sophisticated lungs that allow them to breathe out of water when the ponds they live in dry out.</p>
  <p><strong>400 million years ago:</strong> First insects emerge.</p>
  <p><strong>397 million years ago:</strong> First four-legged vertebrates (tetrapods) evolve from fish, probably in shallow freshwater habitats. The tetrapods conquer the land, and give rise to all amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.</p>
