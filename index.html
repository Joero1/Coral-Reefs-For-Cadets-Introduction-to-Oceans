<h1>Introduction to Oceans</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Why Study the Ocean?</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>About 70% of Earth is covered by ocean</h3>
  <p>The Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land. Of all this water, 97% is found in oceans. The remaining 3% is either locked up in ice caps and glaciers, or is found in fresh-water bodies.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>230 thousand species have been recorded in the ocean</h3>
  <p>There remains a huge number of undiscovered species. There could be anywhere from 1-10 million in total! Although undiscovered, they could still be important for the ecosystem and could hold the key to big scientific breakthroughs.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income</h3>
  <p>‘Aquaculture’ is marine farming. This includes the breeding and harvesting of fish, shellfish and seaweed.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Many other products come from the sea</h3>
  <p>This includes medicine. Coral reefs in particular have very complex ways of fighting off diseases, so there is a lot of interest in this ecosystem from the medical industry.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans</h3>
  <p>As oceans make up most of the Earth’s surface, this means that most of the world remains an unexplored mystery!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>The ocean connects with the land in a 'global ecosystem'</h3>
  <p>The natural world is a highly connected system. An effect on one thing can have widespread effects. Think of a fish in the sea that gets eaten by a bird. This bird may move in land and be food for a bear.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>...and because it is UNDER THREAT</h3>
  <p>Climate change, overfishing and ocean acidification are among another of problems caused by human activity that threaten the ocean. There has never been a more important time to support marine conservation.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Why is the Earth so Wet?</h2>
  <p>For the time being, Earth is the only <em>known</em> planet to have stable bodies of liquid water on its surface. There have been a number of theories as to how are planet came to be so ocean-heavy. These days, most scientists agree on the following explanation.</p>
  <p>Early Earth was a volatile place that was frequently bombarded by asteroids. These asteroids brought with them a very particular chemical. A unique compound made from hydrogen (the first element in the universe) and oxygen (formed from nuclear fusion reactions in stars). We call this chemical water.</p>
  <p>Early Earth was far hotter than it is today due to high volcanic activity and the energy release from swelling pressure inside the planet. At such high temperatures, water remained as gas. The gravity of the Earth prevented it from leaving the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Overtime the Earth's crust began to stabilize, and much of the heat dissipated into space. 3.8 billion years ago,  the Earth cooled below 212 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, the water in the atmosphere condensed into rain. Over millions of years, this rain filled the basins which are now our oceans.</p>
