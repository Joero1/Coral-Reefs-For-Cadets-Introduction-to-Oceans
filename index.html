  <h2>Why Study the Ocean?</h2>
    <p><strong>Approximately 70% of Earth is covered by ocean.</strong><br>
    The Earth's surface is 71% water and 29% land. Of that 71%, 97% is found in the oceans. The remaining 3% is either locked up in the ice caps and glaciers, or is found in fresh water bodies.</p>
  <p><strong>Life started in the ocean.</strong><br>
    Life began at least 3.5 billion years ago in the form of single cells likely formed from chemicals spouted from hydrothermal vents.</p>
    <p><strong>230 thousand species have been recorded in the sea. There may be an estimated 1-10 million in total!</strong><br>
    A huge number of species and taxonomic groups live in the sea. It’s thought the majority of which could be undiscovered, but are nonetheless important for ecological functioning and could hold the key to important scientific breakthroughs.</p>
    <p><strong>10-12% of humans depend on fishing and aquaculture for income.</strong><br>
    Aquaculture is the harvesting of marine resources, e.g. seaweed or shellfish.</p>
    <p><strong>Many products (e.g. medicine) come from the sea.</strong><br>
    Coral reefs in particular have very complex ways of protecting themselves from the reef, so there is a lot of interest in them from the medical industry.</p>
    <p><strong>We have only explored around 5% of the oceans.</strong><br>
    As oceans make up most of the Earth’s crust, this means that most of the world remains unexplored and therefore a mystery!</p>
    <p><strong>The marine ecosystem connects with the land ecosystem to form a 'global ecosystem'.</strong><br>
    The world is a highly connected place. What happens in the ocean effects what happens on the land. For example, fish get eaten by birds. Birds get eaten by land carnivores.</p>
    <p><strong>...And because it is UNDER THREAT.</strong><br>
    The oceans are under assault from an array of anthropogenic disturbances. These include climate change, overfishing, ocean acidification and plastic pollution. There has never been a more important time to support marine conservation!</p>

  <h2>Why is the Earth so Wet?</h2>
      <img vertical-align="middle" src="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/2MNAc96NrZYnDeKftvbMFh-0yoQ=/1072x720/filters:no_upscale()/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/3f/02/3f0239d4-3911-4db9-b592-36b9c597a92c/earlyearth.jpg" width="200" height="120" align="left">
  <p>For the time being, Earth is the only <em>known</em> planet to have stable bodies of liquid water on its surface. There have been a number of theories as to how are planet came to be so ocean-heavy. These days, most scientists agree on the following explanation. Early Earth was a volatile place that was frequently bombarded by asteroids. These asteroids brought with them a very particular chemical. A unique compound made from hydrogen (the first element in the universe) and oxygen (formed from nuclear fusion reactions in stars). We call this chemical water. Early Earth was far hotter than it is today due to high volcanic activity and the energy release from swelling pressure inside the planet. At such high temperatures, water remained as gas. The gravity of the Earth prevented it from leaving the atmosphere. Overtime the Earth's crust began to stabilize, and much of the heat dissipated into space. 3.8 billion years ago,  the Earth cooled below 212 degrees Fahrenheit. At this point, the water in the atmosphere condensed into rain. Over millions of years, this rain filled the basins which are now our oceans.</p>

  <h2>What Makes Up Sea Water?</h2>
  <p><strong>Water</strong><br>
  The chemical formula for water is H2O. This means that each water molecule consists of one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Because water is by far the most abundant liquid on the Earth's surface, it is easy to take for granted. But water is actually quite unusual for a liquid. It has particular properties which make it so perfect (essential even) for life.
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Water is transparent</strong>. This enables light to penetrate it. This means that many marine animals to rely on vision. But even more significantly, it means a high amount of photosynthesis can take place that will produce food that will support the entire marine ecosystem.</li>
  <li><strong>It takes a relatively large amount of energy to raise the temperature of water</strong>. Even when the air temperature changes drastically, the change in water temperature is quite minimal. The stable temperature makes it easier for life to flourish as it doesn't have to adapt to drastic temperature fluctuations.</li>
  <li><strong>It takes a lot of energy to cause water to evaporate by a large amount</strong>.  This also helps keep the ocean stable by preventing it from drying up.</li>
  <li>Unlike other liquids, <strong>water expands when it freezes</strong>. This means frozen water (ice) is less dense and therefore floats on top of liquid water. This is important for the survival of polar and many freshwater organisms because the layer of ice helps trap the remaining heat in the water.</li>
  <li><strong>Water molecules are "sticky"</strong>. In other words, the molecules have forces that keep them attracted to one another. This reinforces the structure of a body of water and allows an entire ecosystem of small organisms to support themselves on the surface of water without sinking (think pond skaters).</li>
  <li>Water is an <strong>excellent 'solvent'</strong>. This means that many substances dissolve easily in water. This is important for many reasons. One reason is because it allows us and other organisms to easily transport important substances around our bodies by dissolving in the blood.</li>
  <li>Water is also quite a <strong>reactive molecule</strong>. It is an important ingredient for many of the reactions that organisms may need to survive, such as photosynthesis.</li>

  </ul></p>
  <p><strong>Salt</strong><br>
  Salt is sodium chloride (NaCl). However, when in liquid, it dissolves into sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Most sea salt comes from the land. Rain has some carbon dioxide dissolved in it making it slightly acidic. This erodes some of the rock, which causes salts and other minerals to leach out and enter the waterways that flow into the ocean. Why aren't rivers salty? Well, they are. But the concentration is low enough that we do not taste it. They are also constantly flowing and this dilutes the salt. There is less evaporation in a flowing river than in a body of water without sufficient means of escape. Many minerals are absorbed in high amounts by aquatic organisms but the salts are not. Hydrothermal vents and underwater volcanoes also contribute to the amount of salt in the ocean. We refer to the 'amount of saltiness' as salinity. About 3.5% of the weight of seawater is salt. If we were to extract all of it from the ocean, it would form a layer across the entire surface of the globe that is 166m thick! The salts are mineralised into the seafloor at roughly the same rate as they are being added to the water. This means the salinity of the ocean stays reasonably constant. However, global warming threatens to disturb the salinity balance due to melting icecaps at the poles and increased evaporation in other parts of the world. Salt is important for organisms as it helps with fluid balance, digestion and more. However most marine life has to deal with an overabundance of salt and therefore evolve ways to keep it out or get rid of what they take in.</p>

<p><strong>Minerals and Nutrients</strong><br>
  There are many other substances in seawater. The amount of life that is produced often depends on the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, iron or carbon in the water. These molecules are taken up by plankton and then passed down the food chain. Most plankton can't just absorb nitrogen in it's pure form, and instead obtain it in the form of ions such as nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4+). Other ions abundant in sea water include potassium (K+) and calcium (Ca2+). These also have important roles in the functioning of organisms. There are also more surprising things in seawater. Every cubic mile of water contains up to 25 pounds of gold. But don't get too excited. A cubic mile of water is more than 100 billon gallons!</p>
  <p><strong>Plankton</strong><br>
  Have you ever accidently swallowed seawater? If so, you probably swallowed thousands of living things including bacteria, worms, crustaceans and fish eggs. We call such things <strong>plankton</strong>. The term "plankton" is not an evolutionary group. It is the word we use when we are referring to organisms that aren't capable of moving against the water current. They are "drifters". Plankton don't always have to be microscopic either. Jellyfish are considered to be the largest plankton. We group plankton into two types. Zooplankton (a.k.a. "animal" plankton) and phytoplankton (a.k.a. "plant" plankton). But here, the term "plant" is used loosely. These are not the same as the "true" plants we find on land. Much of the phytoplankton is actually photosynthetic bacteria.</p>

  <h2>Why is the Sea Blue?</h2>
  <p>Most people think the sea is blue because it reflects the colour of the sky. There is truth in this, which explains why the sea looks much bluer on a clear sunny day. However, it is not the only reason. In fact, even an indoor swimming pool with no exposure to the outdoors would still have water with a blue tint. There just isn't normally enough of it to mask the colour of the backdrop.</p>
  <p>The real reason is to do with the sizes of light waves. Red light has the largest wavelength and is therefore readily absorbed by water molecules. This means that red light is the first to fade as you descend into the sea. If ever you are SCUBA diving and you can see lots of red colour, it is a sign that you are relatively near the surface.</p>
  <p>Blue light has the shortest wavelength, which means it penetrates the deepest of all the colours. It is reflected back rather than absorbed which is why we see it. As you go deeper on your SCUBA dive, you will be left with almost exclusively blue light as the other colours fade.</p>
<img src="https://pngimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/red-glow-line-png-1.png" height="100" width="150">  
<p>Other things can influence the colour of the sea. Areas of highly stirred up sedimentation can make the water more murky and mud-like in colour.  Seasonal seas like those around the UK are particularly green around late Spring. This is caused by large blooms of photosynthetic plankton. In some parts of the world, areas of the sea can even appear red. This is either caused by dust blown over from deserts, or by blooms of red plankton. We call this phenomenon a "red tide".</p>

  <h2>The Depth Zones</h2>
  <p><strong>Pressure</strong> is the force pushing on an object. As you go deeper under water, pressure increases because you are being berried under a greater mass of water. We can measure pressure in units of atmosphere (ATM). Each time you go 1 meter deeper, the pressure increases by 1 ATM. Marine life doesn't get crushed by pressure because water fills spaces in their bodies. This causes a force to push outwards which counteracts the force of the environment pushing on them. Organisms in the deep sea also have extra ways to handle the extreme pressure such as special proteins and structures in their cell membranes to reinforce themselves against being crushed. In the deepest part of the ocean, the pressure is the equivalent of a single person trying to hold 50 jumbo jets!</p>
  <p><strong>The epipelagic (0 – 200m)</strong> – Sometimes called the ‘photic zone’, there is enough sunlight for photosynthesis to happen. Photosynthesis is the process of organisms using sunlight to make food (through the reaction CO2 + H2 -> C6H12O6 + O2). This food can then be passed down the food chain to feed the rest of the ecosystem. We call the process of organisms making their own food ‘primary production’. Because of the high sunlight, most primary production in the ocean happens in the photic zone. This means that the photic zone contains the most life. The actual range of the photic zone will vary depending on how mirky the water is. In some conditions, the photic zone may be less than 100m deep.</p>
  <p><strong>The mesopelagic (200 – 1,000m)</strong> – Sometimes called the ‘twilight zone’, there is some sunlight here but not enough for photosynthesis to take place. Organisms living here rely on particles of food falling from the epipelagic. We call these particles ‘marine snow’. </p>
  <p><strong>The bathypelagic (1,000 – 4,000m)</strong> – This is sometimes called the ‘midnight zone’. There is no sunlight here. The only light present are those produced by living things. To survive here, organisms have to be extremely well-adapted to deal with darkness, food scarcity and the ability to find a mate. </p>
  <p><strong>The abyssopelagic (4,000m < )</strong> – Below 4,000m, we often call this place the ‘abyss’. The temperature here is around 2 to 3oC. Only highly specialised organisms can withstand the immense pressure. However, because the deep sea is so enormous, the abyss actually covers 60% of the Earth’s surface. It is by far the largest habitat on Earth. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Sea Floor</h2>
  <p><strong>Intertidal Zone</strong> - The area where the ocean meets the land between high and low tide.</p>
  <p><strong>Sublittoral Zone</strong> - Starts at the edge of the ocean and slopes down to the continental shelf.</p>
  <p><strong>Continental Shelf</strong> - The edge of a continent under the ocean. It typically lies at around 200 meters deep. Here, there is a transition from a gentle slope to a much steeper drop-off.</p>
  <p><strong>Continental Slope</strong> - The steep slope that proceeds the continental slope and descends down into the abyss.</p>
  <p><strong>Abyssal Plain</strong> - The enormous underwater plain that makes up most of the ocean floor. It usually lies between depths of 3,000 meters and 6,000 meters. The average depth of the ocean is 3,500m. Animals have to be very well adapted to survive here. These include species of sea urchins and sea cucumbers. Populations of these animals may be spread thinly, but the deep sea floor is so huge, that these are some of the most abundant animals on the planet.</p>
  <p><strong>Deep Sea Trenches</strong> - These are found at tectonic plate boundaries and are the deepest parts of the ocean. The deepest of all is the Mariana Trench in the South Pacific. At it's deepest point (named "Challenger Deep"), it is 10,916m from the surface!</p>
  <p><strong>Sea Mounds</strong>  - Mountain ranges are also found in the ocean along tectonic plate boundaries. Sea mounds are important for marine life as they provide a structure that ascends back towards the shallows on an otherwise deep and exposed plain.  The largest mountain on Earth is not Everest but a sea mound called Mauna Kea. It's base is on the deep sea floor but it peaks as a volcano on the island of Hawaii. It is 10,203 meters from base to summit. (Everest stands at a height of 8,848 meters.)</p>

<br>
  <h2>Hydrodynamics</h2>
  <p><strong>Waves</strong> are caused by the wind at the surface (with the exception of tsunamis, which are caused by tectonic activity on the sea floor). This starts the movement of water particles that transfer the energy onto the next particles, in a rolling motion that gets bigger as it moves in a sort of "snowballing" effect. The particles themselves do not keep up with the waves. It is merely the energy that travels. (Think about a Mexican wave. The people do not travel with the wave, they just pass on the movement.) The windier the conditions, and the longer the wave travels, the bigger the wave becomes. Eventually it will reach the coast and the shallow seafloor will interfere with the great rolling wave. It will disrupt the motion and the wave will topple over itself. The wave "breaks".</p>

<p><strong>Tides</strong> refer to the movement of the line where the land meets the water. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon, and to a lesser extent, the Sun. These massive objects have a slight attractive force that draws the water towards it. As the Moon orbits the Earth, its position relative to a particular coastline changes and the bulge of water attracted to it moves with it. This also causes an equal bulge on the opposite side of the Earth. Because the Sun also has a slight pulling effect, the attractive force is strongest when the Sun and the Moon align, because it means the two forces pull in the same direction. At these points the tidal range is greatest each year, i.e. high tide is at its highest and low tide is at its lowest. We call these times spring tide. When the Sun and Moon are perpendicular to one another (from the perspective of the Earth) the forces are at conflict with one another. At these times the tidal range is at its smallest. We call these times neap tide.</p>

<p><strong>Currents</strong> are the continuous and predictable movement of water in the ocean. They are driven by gravity, wind, water density and a phenomenon called the Coriolis Effect. They have large influences on the world's climate. The Gulf Stream, for example, is an Atlantic current that brings warmth to Europe from around Central America. They also help to support life as they transfer nutrients to areas that would otherwise be depleted.</p>

<h2>Latitudinal Zones.</h2>
<p>The temperature of the Earth's crust gets colder as you move away from the equator. This effects the conditions of the ocean at different latitudes. We can loosely distinguish between three ocean zones based on latitude.</p>
    <p><strong>Tropical Seas</strong><br>
    The water temperature is warm - over 18 degrees celsius. There is little fluctuation of conditions making it very stable for life.</p>
    <p><strong>Temperate Seas</strong><br>
    Temperatures range from 10 to 18 degrees celsius. These regions are highly seasonal. In the winter months, the seas are often rough. This increases the mixing of nutrients that causes blooms of plankton at certain times of year.</p>
    <p><strong>Polar Seas</strong><br>
    The waters here are under 10 degrees celsius. Ice often forms on the ocean surface. Animals living here need adaptations to prevent their bodies from feeding.</p>
